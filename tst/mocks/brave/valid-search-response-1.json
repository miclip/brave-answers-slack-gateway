K2 is situated on the border of the Pakistani-Kashmir region Gilgit-Baltistan, and a slice of Kashmir administered by China as part of Xinjiang.",

                    "Following the failed expedition, Crowley notably declared that not the Northeast Ridge, but the Abruzzi Spur (Southeast Spur), was the mountain’s most viable line of ascent. This was the route eventually used by the peak’s first ascensionists and is today considered by far its easiest route. English writer and occultist Aleister Crowley (1875 – 1947), was part of the team to first attempt K2, in 1902. (Photo by Keystone/Getty Images) The Italian Duke of the Abruzzi (Luigi Amedeo) led K2’s second expedition in 1909, but his team was driven back on the eponymous spur at 20,500 feet."

                    "K2 (originally named Mount Godwin Austen) is considered the most difficult and dangerous mountain to climb in the world. Unlike Mount Everest, it is a technical climb and not just any rich person can conquer K2. Located on the China/Pakistan border it reaches 8,611 meters (28,251 ft) into the air. We haven’t laid eyes on K2, nor do we have any intention of climbing it, but I would love to see it one day! And we had to included it since it is the second tallest mountain on earth.",
                    "Between the Bernese Alps of Switzerland where we explored Interlaken and the Pennine Alps where the second tallest mountain in Europe is found, Switzerland houses nine of the ten tallest mountains in the Alps! Monte Rosa is the second highest peak in the Alps bordering both Italy and Switzerland.",

In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft). A 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.",

This route is known for its chaotic rock and snowfields all the way up to the summit. ... First climbed in 1991 by a French team: Pierre Beghin and Christophe Profit. Finishes on North Ridge. The second attempt in 1995 by an American team, they reached 8100 metres the 2 August before turning back in deteriorating weather."

The number of people to have reached the top constitutes only a small fraction compared with how many have successfully climbed Mount Everest.

It is located in the Himalayan mountains on the border between Nepal and China and was climbed for the first time in 1953. Since then, there have been countless other ascents.",
                    "Of course, a mountain can also have further and lower secondary peaks, which are still higher than other mountains. A small hill on top of a large mountain would have an extremely high peak just because of its surroundings — at least if you measure it in relation to sea level. Therefore, in addition to the absolute height, the topographic \"prominence\" is also measured, often called the autonomous height or shoulder drop.",
                    "In general, only the highest point of a mountain is considered a \"peak\" as such. Of course, a mountain can also have further and lower secondary peaks, which are still higher than other mountains.",

At 26,362 feet above sea level, Gasherbrum II has the second-lowest fatality rate of the world’s eight-thousanders, resulting in some pretty adventurous activities including skiing, snowboarding, parachuting, and hang-gliding down from the summit.",
                    "The two nations have debated the summit’s height throughout history, as China's previous official measurement had put the mountain over 13 feet lower than Nepal's. In 2020, however, data from surveys performed in both countries put the new height of the 50-60 million-year-old mountain at 29,031.69 feet, though scientists believe that it is still growing by half a meter per century. The summit only has room for about six people at a time, and concerns about overcrowding on the mountain only increased when microplastics were found near the top in 2020. ... Located along the Pakistan-China border, K2 rises 28,251 feet above sea level, making it the second tallest mountain in the world after Everest.",
                    "While scientific standards do not support the mountain classification at this time, geographers believe that climate change could alter the Karakoram mountain range enough so that it could be a separate formation in the future. From the first summit in 1957 to 2012, Broad Peak was climbed 404 times, an average of just over seven successful summits per year. ... Along the same horseshoe-shaped ridge as Gasherbrum I (which is just 151 feet taller) Gasherbrum’s second-tallest peak is also the 13th highest mountain on Earth.",
